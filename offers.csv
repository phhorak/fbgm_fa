8/24/2020 15:54:36,ThiccThanos,Seattle Symphony,Al Cryer,30,5,"Hi, Mr, Cryer. We the Seattle Symphony would be absolutely in love with you joining our team! Seattle has the best FO in the league as our GMs are ranked 3rd and 9th in GM rankings. Our team is in dire need of an elite QB and you fit the description perfectly! You have been a top notch QB for your career with the Mounties and you have something that our team needs and that is playoff experience! We have the right pieces to contend in all positions outside of QB and if you join us our team will be in a 100% playoff spot. We have the right pieces at RB with Ahmad Lilly who was the best backup RB in the league getting 139 rushes, 716 yards, 5.2 avg, 7 TDs! We as have the RBTY in Reshawn Boozer! He dominated as a rookie getting 2,140 yards of scrimmage and 14 total TDs! He had a very healthy balance of rushing and receiving with 7 TDs rushing and receiving. Also getting decently balanced yardage. With 1,168 rushing yards and 972 receiving yards! Almost had 1k yards in both! Our receiving core is very good as we have Forrest Miller a WR/TE hybrid who can block and get good yardage with his power and strength! Joe Sabbat was our balanced WR who has a good combination of height and speed! He can be very very dangerous if he has a strong arm QB throwing jump balls to him! Tyreece Griffiths
is our speedster as he can just beat his defender in a race 9 times out of 10 his potential is yet to be met and we believe you can get the best out of him! Now at TE we have a potential HOFer in Ryan Johnson! He is one of the most polished and fundamentally sound TEs ever. He has an unbelievable balance of height, strength, route running, hands and his great run blocking! Our offensive line is very solid as it helped Boozer and Lilly get the number 1 rushing game in the league. Our defense was very good too throughtout the season we had the number 1 ranked defense until injuries hit us but our defense is very young and are expected to all get better! Our defensive line the best best young core, our LBs are the best young core, our Safeties were elite in production as one of them made the pro-bowl and our CBs are young and good and are expected to get even better! The young defense overall finished 8th which is very good considering the injures! This situation is the best for you, Mr. Cryer! You get to have an elite receiving core, the best TE duo in Johnson and Miller, a good OL, the best RB duo in the league with the best RB in the league, the best young DL core, the best young LB core, an elite safety duo, and a young and good CB duo! All we need is a QB and you are more than the minimum we can get you are the best we can get! You get all the credit of our success and fame as our team is practically built for your play! You get paid the best too maximum amount of years and the maximum money which is what you deserve. This is the best spot for you in all circumstances and ways, so join the Seattle Symphony Mr. Cryer we would be very pleasured to have you here. "

I'm reaching out as the AGM of the Detroit Muscle to sign you to a 3 year, 6 million dollar contract to be a starting offensive lineman for our organization. Our organization is going through a full rebuild, and we've kickstarted the process by opening up cap room and drafting young, and extremely talented rookies at QB and OL. Your experience would go a very long way in bolstering our OL for our rookie QB and to be part of the backbone for our offense.

I've long held the mentality that the offensive line is the key to a team's success. With the changes we're going through, Detroit is reaching out to multiple young OL to give them the opportunity to spark their careers on a very young team. We'd like to grow together, and set up the core of this team for future success. You're a huge part of that, and we'd love to have you as part of this organization under renewed front office personnel.

The Sacramento Gold Rush is excited to present you with the aforementioned to join our franchise. Our intention is to be very aggressive this offseason and it is our intention to not only target you, but others around you to help solidify our secondary and defense in general. We have been impressed with your career so far and believe you can help turn this into a successful program going forward. 

We understand that our program hasn't been the most appealing in the past, but under new management our expectation is to put us in a position to chase playoff appearances and more in the coming years. We had a very successful draft and now we believe we can make a large impact with this free agency period. 

Our plan is to pair you with Klugey in order to define one of the most potent secondaries in the entire league. You will be asked to lead on and off the field as we set to change the culture here. We feel that pairing you with another high level safety will allow you to continue to improve your production and turn our defense into a unit that has a major impact on our success. 

Our management is committed into turning this thing around and you can be one of the most important pieces in that process. We hope that you will consider this opportunity and enjoy the opportunity of changing the culture here in Sacramento. 

We look forward to hearing from you! "

8/23/2020 21:47:48,AJ,Mexico City Aztecs,Joseph Lewis,30,5,"Hello Mr. Lewis, 

First of all I would just like to thank you for taking the time to meet with me today. As the General Manager of the Aztecs, it would be an understatement to say that we are ecstatic about the opportunity we have to sign you to Mexico City this offseason. Without further ado I would like to get straight to it and show you just how amazing a decision this could turn out to be.

Joseph, every player in the AFF experiences moments that define their careers. The day you get drafted, the day you make your first start, the day you lift that Super Bowl trophy, and the day that you step out onto the field for the final time in your career. In this pitch I want to talk to you about some of these moments.


April 2032: The 2032 AFF Draft commences, for the past year the talk of the draft was your talent and how you were a lock for a top pick in the draft. That night, the Commissioner of the AFF stepped up to the podium and said… “With the 2ndpick in the 2032 AFF Draft, the Detroit Muscle select Joseph Lewis.” Hearing your name first out of the 200+ prospects that were eagerly listening didn’t stump you. You had become accustomed to the bright lights and you calmly walked up to the podium and shook the commissioner's hand ready for what was to come.

Regular Season 2033: In your first ever year in the league, the impact of your talent in the trenches was obvious. That year, Detroit Running Backs combined for over 1600 rushing yards whereas Detroit Quarterbacks put in a respectable 19-7 TD-INT ratio. Additionally, starting QB Lloyd Townsend was only sacked 19 times that year. NINETEEN. For a line led by a young rookie OL like yourself that was truly incredible in your first ever season. It truly set into motion, the events that led you to become an elite talent in the Federation.

Now 5 seasons soon to be 6 seasons and multiple Pro Bowl calibre seasons later you are well on your way to a potential Hall of Fame career and you find yourself a 26 year old in the prime of their career ready to make bank with a big contract for the first time. The Aztecs think we know what you want from your next team, and here’s why that team should be Mexico City.

First of all, Mexico City is still roaring after securing a wild card spot in last year's playoffs despite being one of the youngest teams in the league when it comes to experience in the AFF. While we were unable to do much in the playoffs, with a 10-6 record last year, the only way is up for this team and its clear to see why. Offseason acquisitions Adam Scales and Marcus Norman add tons of experience to the team and the Aztecs are expected to make a DEEP playoff push next season with Super Bowl aspirations for the next few years. Adding you to the team makes us legitimate contenders and at this point in your career I’m sure you’d love to be the leader on a Super Bowl Contender.

Now what may be the most important thing for you this year, I want to talk to you about the contract that you will be offered. While many people believe that long term maxes should only be offered to Franchise QBs I am not of that opinion, I believe that the Offensive Line is MORE important than the players that play behind them, Allow me to make an analogy for a second. When you have a shiny new car, you buy the best insurance you can find. In this case, young QB Josh Palmgren is still adjusting to being a AFF QB, He will be playing his first season as a starter this year and I am ready to invest in a player like yourself to help guide him and protect him in his AFF career. Now where this is leading you might ask? WELL the Aztecs are giving you a 30M/5Y contract which would not only make you the highest paid OL in the league, but also the highest paid player in the AFF. Sounds pretty nice doesn't it. Get paid a ton to play for a contender.

Now before I leave you today, you’ll remember at the beginning of this pitch I mentioned four critical moments in a player’s career, two of yours have already happened and if you sign on with the Aztecs, here’s how I imagine the other two will plan out.

2037 AFF Playoffs: AND THE CLOCK RUNS OUT. The AZTECS ARE YOUR SUPER BOWL WINNERS AND NOW CAPTAIN JOSEPH LEWIS LIFTS THE SB TROPHY. What an amazing season from MXC and the Lewis contract has surely paid off as he puts in an amazing performance to bring his team to the promised land.

2045 AFF Season: AND just like that, the game ends and so does the illustrious career of Joseph Lewis having signed with the Aztecs 5 seasons ago, Lewis has seen it all winning a chip with the Aztecs and playing for 5 great years, now he retires a Hall of Famer and no doubt as one of the greatest players of all time to play OL, WHAT A CAREER FROM LEWIS.

This could be your future and the Aztecs would love to be a part of it. We want you as a part of Aztecs history Joseph and we hope that you want to as well. With that I hope you sign with Mexico City this offseason."
8/23/2020 17:59:51,Johnnie,Vancouver Whalers,Joseph Lewis,25,5,"Joseph Lewis, I would like for you to join my team. Firstly, we know you’re an amazing pass blocker, and with our wideouts and quarterback, you’d fit right into our team. You’re obviously gonna be a starter, but also I’d like to give you a 5 year deal because I trust you to be a premier OL for this team for a long time, and I’d like to promise to keep MM for a long time. Plus, we added Jordan Marsh, an another great OL, so we have a good OL around you. Yes, we weren’t great last year as a team, but hopefully you join the team."
8/24/2020 15:49:27,Durantula,Philadelphia Liberty,Joseph Lewis ,24,4,Come on back to Philly my man we need you and we willing to pay. Sorry for whatever we did to make you refuse but we very seriously believe in you my man

We are very excited to reach out to you in regards to joining our franchise. We are rebuilding this roster into a contender and are looking to bring you in to lead us. We had a very successful draft in which we were able to grab potential franchise OL and WR for you to operate with. 

Sacramento has not been an ideal situation for a QB in the past, but it is our goal to find the right signal called and develop a roster around him. We truly feel that you can not only be that guy, but develop us into a playoff contender in the near future. 

Your production last season was on par with what we're looking for and we believe that we can continue to elevate that in the sense of completion percentage and your TD/INT ration. There will be be plenty of weapons to engage with and we won't stop searching for the right combinations that work with your skill set until we find them. 

Our staff knows that you will receive plenty of interest this offseason, but we truly feel that your home could be in Sacramento. You will can be the catalyst that drives our club going forward. 

We hope to see a commitment from you soon! "

You're tired of playing for a choking QB? Porter already proved he could lead a good offense to a ring! With Kraus at RB and Park at TE you would provide us with one great weapon at position.

We really appreciate your ability to make a difference due to your athleticism and your excellent route running ability.

Come to Denver,

The Sacramento franchise is very excited to reach out to with our proposed offer for you to join our club. Your production and development during your time int he league has been very impressive and has caught our attention. We foresee you being a key cog in our efforts to re-tool and revitalize this club. 

You will have an opportunity to anchor a secondary that has some pieces, but needs a leader. We feel that your talent and potential going forward will fit perfectly into our plan to charge this roster with youthful talent that can help us with an upward trajectory starting this season. 

We understand that this has not been a franchise that many would handpick to join in previous years, but our new front office staff has a vision for putting this club in a position to win early and often. There will be many changes as we go forward, but your impact could start the momentum that we need to truly get this thing headed in the right direction. 

Our focus will be on targeting the most impactful individuals possible at all three levels of the defense and building around them. We expect you to be a centerpiece for our defense and franchise and will tirelessly pursue the proper pieces that fit around you. 

We hope you will consider the opportunity for helping make Sacramento into a perennial playoff team in the near future. "
