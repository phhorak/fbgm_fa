4/2/2020 16:59:39,El Griegongolongo,Montreal Mounties,Berkley Cochrane,11.05,1,"Being overlooked, whether it be in your job, in your personal life, or even literally, is perhaps one of the worst feelings in the world. People criticized you for something you could not control, and that made you fall in the draft. It's not your fault you're 5'4, you can't control that.

But instead of giving up, you rose to the occasion. Everything that was under control you refined, you improved. You worked hard to become a crucial rotation piece in a team that won three super bowls.

Yet, you still seem overlooked. You are not the top free-agent prospect in any other team's eyes. They still see you as an extremely undersized cornerback who just got drafted to the right team.

But we dont.

The Montreal Mounties organization is going to offer you the opportunity to prove yourself to the AFF. A one-year, 11.05 million dollar contract, along with a practically guaranteed starting position. If you succeed, and we believe you will, you will finally win perhaps the only thing greater than a Super Bowl ring.

The validation of the AFF, the recognition of your talent.

We expect to see you in training camp,

El Griegongolongo,
Montreal Mounties General Manager

4/3/2020 23:32:33,El Griegongolongo,Montreal Mounties,Marc Copp,9.14,1,"When you came to Montreal and became the franchise quarterback, expectations for the future were relatively high. However, things didn't quite work out at the time, and I understand that things did not end amicably. I wouldn't be surprised if you don't bother to consider to even read this offer.

We failed to treat you like the franchise quarterback you were.

They say that time heals all wounds, and, from my end, that has been the case. 

I want to make this right.

Even if there are ""better"" quarterbacks out in the market, (something which I disagree with) it only would make sense for our organization, for our team, to have you return as our quarterback. Not only because of your talent but because of your experience and your leadership, which would be greatly beneficial to our locker room.

Therefore, The Montreal Mounties would like to offer you a 9.14 million dollar contract for the 2028 season to be the prime candidate to start at the quarterback position.

If you get a better offer for significantly more money, I completely understand you not coming to our organization, and there would be no hard feelings. This is a business after all.

But if you want to give us another opportunity, we will make sure that you are treated fairly for the remainder of your career by us.

The Mexico City Aztecs would like to sign you to be our #1 WR for this season and beyond. We've got all the pieces in place apart from a top WR, and we think you're going to be our new offensive star.

We're committed to bringing a Super Bowl to Mexico City. We've gone to the playoffs twice in the last two years under my tenure, and reached the Super Bowl in my first season. That season, I had an All-Pro Wide Receiver on my team, Joel Southall. I'm sure you know him.

We moved on from Joel because of our interest in you. Your athleticism, your consistency, your desire to be great, they all shine. You embody what it means to be an Aztec. We may not offer you as high a contract as others will, but you would be stepping into one of the best offenses in the league. Marko Perovic throwing you passes, Frank Jackson pounding the ball through defenses, and hopefully you. Dominating DB's every game. 

Will you join us on our chase for a ring?

The Mexico City Aztecs would like to sign you to be our backup QB for this season and possibly the QB of our future. We've got all the pieces in place apart from a capable backup QB, and we think you're going to fill that role, and hopefully even more.

We're committed to bringing a Super Bowl to Mexico City. We've gone to the playoffs twice in the last two years under my tenure, and reached the Super Bowl in my first season.

I understand that our contract offer may not be lucrative compared to other teams, but we offer you what other teams can't. A chance to have your name written in the history books as ""Brandon Matute - Super Bowl Champion."" No one's ever really given you a shot. St. Louis  didn't give you the pieces to win. New York was committed to the tank. Kansas City didn't even let you see the field. We're different.

We're offering you a two year contract so that if you step into a starting role, we can pay you as such. You deserve to have your talents recognized, and this deal gives you that flexibility. You'd be able to negotiate a new contract at 27 years old, in your prime.

Take our offer. Win a ring as a backup this season. Then be the QB of our future.

We look forward to you joining us in Mexico City. Our fans can't wait to see you on the field.
